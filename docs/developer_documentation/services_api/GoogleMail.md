## Introduction

The Gmail API provides a way to access Gmail mailboxes and messages through HTTPS/REST API for general operations.
The Gmail API is a RESTful API that can be used to access Gmail mailboxes and send mail.
For most web applications the Gmail API is the best choice for authorized access to a user's Gmail data and is suitable for various applications, such as:

- Read-only mail extraction, indexing, and backup
- Automated or programmatic message sending
- Email account migration
- Email organization including filtering and sorting of messages
- Standardization of email signatures across an organization

## Authentication

Using OAuth 2.0, you can authenticate your application with Gmail.

The authentication process involves the following steps:

- Your application specifies the required permissions.
- User consent is obtained when your application requests access to Gmail data.
- Tokens are exchanged upon user authorization, allowing API requests on behalf of the user.

For detailed steps, refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/overview#auth)
